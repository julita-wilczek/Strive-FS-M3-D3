Functionalities:

2. Press the **Load secondary Images** button to load cat pictures
3. Replaced the **Edit** buttons on the cards with a **Hide** button using DOM manipulation. 
4. When **Hide** button pressed, the whole card disappears. 
5. Replaced using DOM manipulation the **9 mins** string in the cards with the ID of the image
6. Added a search input field. Search for content that you want displayed in the pictures.
